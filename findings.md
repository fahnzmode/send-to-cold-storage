# Findings & Decisions
<!--
  WHAT: This file stores all research, discoveries, and information you learn during the task.
  WHY: Your context window is limited. Writing findings here creates persistent memory.
  WHEN: Update after every 2 view/browser/search operations to prevent information loss.
-->

## Requirements
<!--
  WHAT: Specific deliverables and constraints from the user.
  WHY: Keeps you aligned with what was actually asked for.
  WHEN: Fill this in during Phase 1 after understanding the user's needs.
-->
-

## Research Findings
<!--
  WHAT: Key discoveries from exploration, searches, and reading.
  WHY: Information found early is often needed later. This prevents re-searching.
  WHEN: Update after every 2 view/browser/search operations (the "2-Action Rule").
-->
-

## Technical Decisions
<!--
  WHAT: Architecture and design choices with rationale.
  WHY: Decisions need justification. This helps you remember why you chose an approach.
  WHEN: Update during Phase 2 (Planning) and whenever you make significant choices.
-->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Issues Encountered
<!--
  WHAT: Problems you've run into and how you solved them.
  WHY: Issues often recur. Documenting solutions prevents repeating mistakes.
  WHEN: Update immediately when you encounter and resolve an issue.
-->
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
|       |            |

## Resources
<!--
  WHAT: Reference links, file paths, and external resources.
  WHY: Quick access to important references without re-searching.
  WHEN: Add whenever you find a useful resource.
-->
-

## Visual/Browser Findings
<!--
  WHAT: Text captures of multimodal content (screenshots, web pages, diagrams).
  WHY: Visual information is lost when context resets. Text captures preserve it.
  WHEN: Update IMMEDIATELY after viewing any visual content.
